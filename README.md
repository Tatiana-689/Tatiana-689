#### Description:
I WANT TO PRESENT MY PROJECT FOR IMAGE EDITOR.
This application can be used online.
With it, you can easily and quickly edit any image and save it to your computer.
You can use functions such as blur, contrast, hue-rotate, sepia.
And you can also reflect and rotate the image as you want.
In my project I used JavaScript, Python, and Flask.

**index.html**
The main page of my project is index.html . This page contains all the interface markup.

**run.py**
File run.py it contains the code for saving images and launching the main page index.html . Flask is used for this. And the language in which the file is written is Python.

**script.js**
This file contains JavaScript code with which all image editing takes place.
Here are all the functions that you see on your screen at startup index.html

**node2image.js**
It is another file written in JavaScript. This is the node for the image.
